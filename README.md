# CommonJS React Components

![Image](screenshot.png?raw=true "screenshot")

## Goals

A simple proof-of-concept inspired by this [article](http://simonsmith.io/writing-react-components-as-commonjs-modules/)

- Use [CommonJS Modules](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-javascript-design/9781449334840/ch11s03.html) to build and share UI components
- Abstract away the component's implementation without leakage so that it can be consumed without knowledge of a 
specific library or framework
- No component API, event all interaction

Utilizes vanilla JavaScript DOM eventing, and styled using the ubiquitous Bootstrap v3 for mobile-first responsiveness.

## Prerequisites

Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/). This automatically installs npm.

## Tool Chain

Now using [webpack](http://christianalfoni.github.io/javascript/2014/12/13/did-you-know-webpack-and-react-is-awesome.html) !
(replaces Grunt/Browserify)

    npm install webpack -g 

### Can I see the project working before I change anything?

After cloning the repo:

    cd commonjs-react-components
    npm install
    npm run dev

Once the above is complete, open a browser tab to localhost:8080. In this scenario, the dev.card-component.js is in-memory!

### How do I create the minified distribution version?

    webpack -p
    
Then script include the 'build/dist.card-component.js' in your consuming markup.

### Live Reload

Live reload is activated, so that any saved change to the watched source automatically reloads the browser page.
